This project can be used to check the client traffic flow between h1 and h2, which follows the following path:
 h1 - s1 - l1 - s1 - s3 - n1 - s3 - s2 - l2 - s2 - h2

Also it can be used to check the load balancers synchronization traffic flows, which follows the following path:
 l1 - s1 - s3 - s2 - l2
 
Client's traffic openflow rules are based on ports, while load balancers synchronization traffic flows openflow rules are based on ip addresses.
